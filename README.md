# Front-End Developer Recruitment Task
Hi!
We are happy you are interested in the Front-End Developer position at Vivic Labs.
We have got a task for you.

This is a widget you could find in a mobile banking app. Can you create something like this?

![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vivic-Labs/Front-End-Developer-Recruitment-Task/master/images/preview.png = 800px)

Create a widget component shown on the preview.
Use the data from **data.json** file.

### Some hints
1. We will judge you based on the final result as well as code quality and following best practices.
2. We would like you to use the modern features of the framework you are applying for. ES6 is a must.
3. Don't go crazy about it. The basic functionality is displaying:
- account balance,
- account number,
- list of 3 most recent transactions,
- display transaction details when clicked.
4. Write code that could be used in a real-world app with as little changes as possible. You can use comments to explain where and how would you fetch data in a real app.
5. Try to be reasonably close to the provided design. No need for being pixel-perfect here.
6. We provided you with the icons used in the preview.
7. Don't worry about stuff like authentication etc.

### Submission
Preferably, we would like you to submit your code via platforms like [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) or [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com) or by sending us your git repository. Remember, we should be able to run your code without any problems.

Good luck! If having any questions, reach us at **careers@viviclabs.com**
