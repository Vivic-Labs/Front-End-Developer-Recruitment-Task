### Rules & hints
1. We will judge you based on the final result as well as code quality and following best practices.
2. We would like you to use modern features of the framework you are applying for. ES6 is a must.
3. Don't go crazy about it. The basic functionality is displaying:
- account balance,
- account number,
- list of 3 most recent transactions,
- display transaction details when clicked.
4. Try to be reasonably close to the provided desing. No need for being pixel-perfect here.
5. We provided you with icons used in the preview.
